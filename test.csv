1,1,"Undoubtedly putting more commuters on electric transit rather than on petro consuming private vehicles would be a plus. Similarly, turning more space from roadways to walkways would make the core a greener and more welcoming space. 

Public transit use declined over the pandemic and has stayed down since. That's meant a noticeable increase in congestion on the roads. Drivers are fully aware, but keep driving. It's worth considering why. 

Anecdotally, pre-pandemic my wife preferred transit. They've discontinued the route she took from near our home to the heart of the city, so the trip now involves more transfers and more time. She finds that subway's are flooded during rush hour, often meaning a 15 minute delay until she can get on a train. When she does get on, she often feels unsafe. 

Generally, our transit system is inadequate, poorly maintained, and many believe it's unsafe. Until that's changed, we can try to force people back to transit, but those who can afford to dive will continue to do so. Expert input suggests we'll need sustained annual investment over 10+ years to begin improving Toronto's transit situation. Keeping investment going, year after year, is important to create and maintain the expertise and the resources needed for successful implementation of new lines. Cities such as Madrid have shown the way.",en

> The city doesnâ€™t plan to go that far. It is moving into the consulting phase in its plan to reduce that stretch of Yonge Street to two lanes and expand sidewalks and bike lanes, as well as â€œactivityâ€ sections for cafe-style seating. Construction is not expected to start for two years.
> 
> Chapple would like to see the area pivot away from big-box store â€œstreet-killersâ€ to small business store fronts that are pedestrian-friendly. But more than that, she suggests the vision for the square be focused on making it a gathering place and then seeing what fits around it.

More than 100 tenants at two northwest Toronto apartment buildings will go on rent strike Sunday, joining the ranks of nearly 500 residents who have been withholding payments since early summer.
  

  
The tenants, residing at 1440 and 1442 Lawrence Avenue West, claim their landlord, Barney River Investments, has refused to address serious repairs in the building while attempting to implement above-guideline rent increases.

According to Padovani, the deteriorating conditions at the northwest Toronto residences, including a serious insect infestation, have gotten to the point that Canada Post has ceased mail delivery to the residences citing unsafe working conditions.
  

  
Padovani says the buildings' elevators are often out of service â€“ an accessibility concern for residents â€“ and that the garbage chutes have not been properly maintained.

Paradoxically, this abundance can lead to indecision and a sense of always seeking something better. Dating apps are often designed to keep users engaged, not necessarily in successful relationships, which can contribute to the feeling of being perpetually single. They prioritize user retention and monetization, sometimes at the expense of genuine connections.

Joining a club or hobby that aligns with your interests is a great way to break the cycle of endless swiping on dating apps. It allows you to connect with people who share your passions, making it more likely to form meaningful connections that could lead to meeting someone special. It's a refreshing approach to dating that can offer a more genuine and fulfilling experience.

Hidalgo is not a popular figure among Parisians, to say the least.
I've noticed more trees (which is nice), less cars, more bikes.
I am a pedestrian and won't ever ride a bike again in Paris (too dangerous), so these changes are quite neutral to me. People on bikes can be more dangerous than people in cars.
Hidalgo banned self-service electric scooters for that reason.
Otherwise the changes are quite subtle, Paris was already a walkable city before them. It affects commuters a lot more. From what I understand, having less cars in Paris is nice for Parisians, not so much for people in the suburbs since getting to Paris by car is more difficult, and since traffic jams are now deported in the suburbs.

Will have to wait until the Olympics to see how it plays out.

I can't say if it has made Paris more livable, but I feel like there are more urgent things to do than put bike lanes everywhere. However, planning for global warming (as Hidalgo is doing) is quite welcome, Paris becomes a living hell during the heatwaves.",en

-When youâ€™re about to get off the metro, you see a bunch of people not making space or be patient enough for you to leave first. They think itâ€™s fine to just come right in, not knowing/caring if someoneâ€™s getting out.

-When taking the automatic stairs, thereâ€™s always people taking all the place when youâ€™re trying go up faster because youâ€™re in a hurry or generally walk faster. Some are so unaware/careless that they think they can just take all the place and block you from passing by. Itâ€™s important to know that there are 2 invisible lanes in the stairs: to your left side, itâ€™s for people who are not in a hurry, just wanna chill there and wait to go up. To your right side, itâ€™s for those who wanna go up faster or are in a hurry. Itâ€™s simple.

-In buses, Iâ€™ve noticed a recurrent pattern (especially in larger STM buses). When thereâ€™s an agglomeration of people in the bus, somehow, people are afraid or feel awkward to go in the back. Therefore, it creates this gap in the middle of the bus as almost empty and as well in the back. However, in front, itâ€™s packed It seems that some people are so afraid or feel awkward to say â€œexcuse meâ€ to go further in the back so the new comers can have enough space to even walk in the bus. Then, itâ€™s another story on top of that when you voice out that you wanna leave or move when theyâ€™re glued and have their headphones on, completely disconnected of their environment.

If you follow a science curriculum, you absolutely need to pass physics and chemistry, both requiring laboratory experiments, usually in teams, with equipment that are out of reach to home school parents.

In social sciences working as part of a team is usually mandatory, then presentations in front of the class, public speaking are part of many of the classes you must pass.

As for technical training, most, if not all, require equipment that is usually quite expensive and specialized teachers with knowledge and experience that cannot be found in books.
