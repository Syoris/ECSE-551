      "[\"From what I have seen in my neighbourhood, too many people would rather take the chance and risk a parking ticket than pay for parking.  Two green P lots within walking distance of my street (one block and two blocks away) and everything day there's cars parked on the wrong side (it's a one way street) or blocking driveways.  If Toronto wants to raise rates, they should also consider increasing their parking enforcement efforts. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the article:\\r\\n\\r\\n> This fall, Toronto will launch consultations on a citywide parking strategy that could lead to changes in how much real estate the city devotes to stationary vehicles, and how much drivers pay for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n>The exercise is part of a global trend that has urban centres around the world reconsidering decades-old planning orthodoxy that dictates cities need ample and cheap parking in order to thrive. Proponents of the new philosophy argue that reducing the amount of low-cost parking frees up street space for other public uses, reduces traffic and helps meet climate targets. But any proposal to make parking less readily available and more expensive is sure to provoke pushback from drivers already facing higher costs and business owners struggling to recover from the pandemic\\r\\n\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\n>Patrick Siegman, a San Francisco-based transportation planner, said there\\x92s a sea change underway in how cities think about parking. \\x93I have never seen anything like it\\x94 in 30 years in the field, he said. \\x93Parking reform is really snowballing.\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\n>In 2022, roughly one-quarter of the parking authority\\x92s 250 off-street lots had peak weekday occupancy rates of at least 85 per cent, the level at which a facility is considered overcapacity and a candidate for higher prices. Rates at most off-street lots range from about $1 to $4 per half-hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n>Jeff Dea, vice-president of business development at the Toronto Parking Authority, said the agency\\x92s approach is to set prices that are reasonable but high enough to discourage long-term stays, as frequent turnover allows more people to use the spot and shop at local businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n>The parking authority typically reviews prices annually at off-street lots and every three years at on-street spots, but because of the pandemic, on-street rates haven\\x92t been increased since 2017. Dea acknowledged rates are now \\x93a little bit low\\x94 and the agency will recommend \\x93modest\\x94 on-street raises to its board in November. But \\x93we\\x92re not looking at dramatic increases,\\x94 he said.\", \"Copenhagen broke ground on their new subway lines at the same time as the Eglinton LRT.

The reality is that crashing the housing market and reducing house prices by 50% overnight will cause more economic problems than it would solve housing issues. \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore any approach should be focused around three things:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) bringing stability to housing prices. If people know that a 350k house will still be worth 350k in two years time that helps when it comes to savings and planning. This has to come through increasing the supply, either through more house building or making it less attractive to own empty properties.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) restrict predatory activities by landlords - limit rental increases to inflation, stricter policies around repairs etc., no no fault evictions\\r\\n\\r\\n3) make non-housing purchase costs cheaper for young buyers. E.g., I'd suggest making stamp duty payable at the point of sale rather than purchase. That guarantees zero stamp duty for first time buyers, and means those who benefit most from house price inflation pay their fair share. Introduce a rental properties purchaae tax to keep higher costs on buying property to rent out. Maybe also set up a subsidised conveyancing service for FTB as well to help with those costs.\", '\\r\\nI\\x92m hopeful that aliens are gonna come soon  and there will be a fresh pool of handsome Plutonians who are gonna be emotionally mature and able to do some new and awesome multidimensional stuff sexually.  ??', \"Like many things a HEAVY separation from companies to what should be the people's resource.\\r\\n\\r\\nIDK know a lot about how housing works but:\\r\\n\\r\\nRestrictions on how many homes a single person can own and buy, all houses must be brought under a name not a company.  \\r\\nCompany owned living facilities like hotels must be built/converted from non housing structures. \\r\\n\\r\\nA Cap on house value and rent per square meter, while also gutting out any middle men who inflate house building costs though laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nChange the way houses are valued, everyone needs a place to live regardless of its location.  \\r\\nIt should be valued for what it is and its condition, not locations, views etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnoccupied homes will be taxed for future government build projects, landlords can choose to reliquish their property if they are unable to sell it, this is where future build projects can take over to renovate and sell/rent to further add to their own funding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost of rent will be based on maintenance of the property only, paying to *occupy a* property is worthless since it would be taxed otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nExploits in the housing market will be monitored by an independant body so house costs remain low to protect the people, repeated offenders will lose the property/ies involved and be taken over by future build projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nExisting company **brought** homes must be sold or face fines after any existing tenancy agreement has ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nI get that there maybe some rough edges to iron out on this and some details to fill in, but having any solution is better than just complain about the problem.\", 'Have you tried [this website](https://www.recycleyourelectricals.org.uk/)?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor appliances that are still functional, stick them on [trash nothing](https://trashnothing.com/beta/browse).

The main ones are:\\r\\n\\r\\n**1. Being obnoxious (speaking loudly) / attention-seeking behaviors.**\\r\\n\\r\\nDiscretion and a \"Less is more\" philosophy are considered to be \"polite\", \"elegant\" and \"chic\" behaviors. That is even more the case in places of cultural and historical relevance. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut that also works for hotels and restaurants, the subway/bus, or any public place.\\r\\n\\r\\n**2.

Not trying to adapt or understand other countries\\' cultures.**\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter usually comes from a lack of understanding and education about the culture in question. Understanding a country\\'s culture takes years of both living in the country, and speaking its language fluently. You cannot google that or watch a YouTube tutorial.

Je conseille généralement aux gens de les envisager lors du remplacement d'un appareil de chauffage en fin de vie, car nous nous éloignons du gaz et un appareil de chauffage électrique est un bon moyen de brûler de l'argent. Si tu as la clim ou si tu envisages d'en installer une (murale ou centrale), il n'y a aucune raison de ne pas en acheter une. \\r\\n\\r\\nJe déconseille de surestimer leur capacité de chauffage, sauf si tu peut acheter un beau système à deux stages ($), et même dans ce cas, tu n'auras plus que 20 % de la capacité (BTU/h) nominale à -20 °C, même si le COP reste respectable.

If you have AC or are adding an AC (mural or central) there is no reason to not get one. \\r\\n\\r\\nI do caution against over estimation of their heating capacity unless you can afford a nice two stage system ($) and even then you drop to 20% of the nominal capacity at -20C even if the COP is still respectable. That being said those are edge cases for our winters that are getting more mild and you should have auxiliary heating (electric or gas) as backup anyway. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have debated with refrigeration journeymen about increased wear by having higher operating pressures (the refrigerant is pressurized to a much higher degree to seek the thermal energy over a higher temperature difference).
